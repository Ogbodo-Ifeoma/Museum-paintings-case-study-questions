# Analyzing the World Museum Database

## Role: Data Analyst at Global Artifacts Inc.
As a Data Analyst at Global Artifacts Inc., a company that provides data-driven
insights to museums and art collectors worldwide, I was tasked with analyzing the
**World Museum Database**. This database contains rich information on artworks, artists,
museums, and various aspects of the global art industry. The goal was to extract
actionable insights from the database, helping our clients—museums, art galleries, 
and collectors—understand key trends, optimize their operations, and make data-backed decisions.

## Task: Gaining Insights from the World Museum Database
At Global Artifacts Inc., our team regularly uses datasets like the World Museum Database 
to assist museums in optimizing how they showcase art, manage collections, 
and price valuable pieces. As part of my analysis, I focused on a series of key questions 
to gain insights into museum operations, art pricing, and artist popularity.
To accomplish this, I queried the database, which comprises multiple interconnected tables 
representing artists, artworks, museum locations, painting sizes, pricing, and much more.

## Conclusion:
By querying the World Museum Database, I was able to extract actionable insights such as
identifying which museums need more artwork, analyzing pricing trends in the art market, 
and revealing top artists and painting subjects. These insights help museums optimize their 
operations, improve pricing strategies, and offer data-driven solutions to improve visitor
engagement and boost collections.
